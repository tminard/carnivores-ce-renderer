Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Service. By using the Service
(or installing any game/app or clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option
is made available to you), you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and
our Privacy Policy, found at #7http://tatemgames.com/page/privacy-policy/#0, which is hereby expressly
incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy
Policy, you must not access or use the Service.

The Service is offered and available to users who are 13 years of age or older. By accessing
or otherwise using the Service, you represent that you are age 13 or older and you understand and
agree to these Terms of Service. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, your legal guardian must
review and agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must
not access or use the Service. If you are a legal guardian, you must restrict all use of the Service
by minors, and you will deny access to children under the age of 13. You accept full responsibility
for any unauthorized use of the Service by minors.


#5Right to Use the Service#0

Subject to these Terms of Service, Tatem hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use the Service for your personal, non-commercial
use. The rights granted to you are subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service.

Except as previously set forth, you do not receive any other license. Tatem retains all right, title
and interest in and to the Services, including, but not limited to, all copyrights, trademarks,
trade secrets, trade names, proprietary rights, patents, titles, computer codes, audiovisual
effects, themes, characters, character names, stories, dialog, settings, artwork, sound effects,
musical works, gameplay recordings made using the Service, moral rights, whether registered or not
and all applications thereof. Unless expressly authorized by law, the Service may not be copied,
reproduced or distributed in any manner or medium, in whole or in part, without Tatem prior written
consent. Tatem reserves all rights not expressly granted to you herein.

#5The Service and its contents are licensed, not sold.#0 You agree that you have no right or title in or
to any content that appears in the Service, including, but not limited to, the Virtual Items
or currency appearing in or originating from the Service, whether earned in the Service or purchased
from Tatem or third parties.


#5Purchases Terms and Conditions#0

All purchases on or through the Service are governed by the following terms and conditions.

#4*#0 In the Service you may purchase, with "real world" money, a limited, personal,
    non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use (a) "virtual currency", including
    but not limited to virtual cash, all for use in Tatem games; (b) "virtual in-game items"
    (together with "virtual currency", "Virtual Items"); and (c) other goods or services
    ("Merchandise").
#4*#0 Tatem may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items and/or Merchandise at any
    time, with or without notice. Tatem shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event
    that Tatem exercises any such rights.
#4*#0 The transfer of Virtual Items and Merchandise is prohibited except where expressly authorized
    in the Service. Other than as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, redeem
    or otherwise transfer Virtual Items or Merchandise to any person or entity, including but not
    limited to Tatem, another user or any third party.
#4*#0 The provision of Virtual Items for use in Tatem games is a service provided by Tatem that
    commences immediately upon acceptance by Tatem of your purchase.
#4*#0 You agree that a third party (e.g. Apple or Google) will process and accept your orders and
    payments and therefore the Tatem does not have possibilities to process or manage possible refund
    requests or any other requests or questions relating to your payments or orders. Therefore, if you
    may have any refund requests or any other questions or requests relating to your orders or payments,
    we encourage you to directly contact the party, who has given you an order receipt or similar
    confirmation letter and hence is the party processing your orders and payments.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TATEM IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL
NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER
SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD PARTY VIRTUAL
CURRENCY MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.

Tatem owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears in the
Service or in Tatem games. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, you agree that you
have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without
limitation the Virtual Items appearing or originating in any Tatem game, whether earned in a game
or purchased from Tatem.


#5Changes to the Service#0

We may update the content on the Service from time to time, but its content is not necessarily
complete or up-to-date. Any of the material on the Service may be out of date at any given time, and
we are under no obligation to update such material.


#5User Contributions#0

The Service may allow you to create content, including, but not limited to, gameplay maps,
characters, screenshots or videos of your gameplay (collectively "User Contributions").

In exchange for use of the Service, you hereby grant Tatem a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual,
irrevocable, fully transferable and sub-licensable worldwide right and license to use your User
Contributions in any way and for any purposes including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce,
copy, adapt, modify, perform, display, publish, broadcast, transmit, or otherwise communicate to the
public by any current or future means and to distribute your User Contributions without any further
notice or compensation to you of any kind.

Where not expressly prohibited by law, you hereby waive any moral rights of paternity, publication,
reputation, or attribution with respect to Tatem's and other players' use and enjoyment of your User
Contributions in connection with the Services and related goods and services under applicable law.
This grant of license to Tatem, and the foregoing waiver of any applicable moral rights, survives
any termination of these Term of Service.

Tatem, its directors, officers and employees do not accept or consider unsolicited idea or product
submissions of any kind (e.g. game or other product ideas, stories, screenplays, artwork, musical
or audiovisual works, concepts or any other creative materials) in any format, by means of any
transmission ("#5Unsolicited Content#0"). Please do not submit any Unsolicited Content to Tatem or its
directors, officers or employees. However, if you submit Unsolicited Content to us, you agree that
such Unsolicited Content will not be treated as confidential, regardless of what you otherwise state
in your accompanying message. You further agree that such Unsolicited Content may be used and
exploited by Tatem without compensation to you or any third party and you grant Tatem a perpetual,
non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully paid, royalty free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole
or in part) worldwide license to use, exploit, reproduce, transmit, amend, display and exhibit
Unsolicited Content in all current or future media for any purpose and to create derivative works
based upon the Unsolicited Content.
