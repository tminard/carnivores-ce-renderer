# Carnivores Renderer

## How to use

You may need to install the [OpenAL runtime.](https://www.openal.org/downloads/).

Delete current config.json and rename `config.json.example`, then edit to point to your maps.

Note that maps MUST currently be copied to some location under `runtime` in the config (or you can use a relative path). This will be addressed in future versions.
